        <div id="about" class="about">
                <p>As a raised Oregonian I have the typical outdoor hobbies. I am a hiker, a snowboarder, a skateboarder and a surfer.
                    Having gone snowboarding at leat once a month for the last 14 months, i'd say snowboarding is my favorite.
                    Before this bootcamp started I was working at a ski resort in Eastern Washington as a member of the park crew building and grooming the park features.
                    I came back to Oregon right before the New Year as I found out that I am pregnant. Due a month after we finish bootcamp! 
                    <br><br>
                    I accomplished a Bachelors of Science in Microbiology and Chemistry where I went on to work in clinical trial phase pharmaceuticals
                    to working in the cannabis industry as an extraction technician to working in quality control at a hazelnut production facility.
                    I have a wide range of skills associated with my degree and have put that to in a few different industries. My goal with attending and
                    completing this bootcamp if to be able to utilize my knowledge in a different way by being able to create and or help create ways of making
                    scientific processes more streamline, accurate, or efficient.
